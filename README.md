# CodeLab

Code together, stay apart. CodeLab is a realtime collaborative coding webapp with direct WebRTC video calls, two-way code sharing (co-browsing), rich messaging with image uploading and builtin automatic translation between the users if they do not speak the same language, instant teacher feedback and other features.

CodeLab was developed at the 48 hours Tech Mahindra Hackathon, Feb. 6 to Feb. 8, 2015, at the University of Texas at Dallas.
